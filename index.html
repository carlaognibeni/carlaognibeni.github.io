                <p>I am a third-year journalism student at the University of Florida specializing in online journalism. I will graduate in May of 2015. Interested in all things news and media related, I am looking for a summer internship to further my reporting, writing and multimedia skills.
</p><p>
            I am currently interning as a part-time reporter for the Gainesville Sun, Gainesville’s city newspaper. I work in the newsroom 20 hours a week. I  mostly write for the business beat, assisting business editor Anthony Clark.
</p><p>
            I have most recently interned with University of Florida Relations as a social media intern. I was responsible for creating and managing the content for UF’s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Vine accounts. A few of my duties included answering and creating Facebook posts for an audience of more than 500,000 fans, writing accurate and relevant tweets for UF’s 59,000+ followers and photographing official UF events. Special attention was placed on accuracy and timeliness, two crucial aspects within the news realm.
</p><p>
            During this time I also worked as a correspondent for the Gainesville Sun. The business editor would send me one to two story assignments per week. The deadline for each depended on the timeliness of the story.
</p><p>
            Before this, I spent 8 months interning with Gainesville Today magazine. As an editorial intern, I was responsible for pitching creative ideas and writing 1500- to 2500-word feature stories for each monthly issue. While working on my feature-writing skills, I learned to pay close attention to the smallest details – because they’re the essence of all feature stories.
</p><p>
            I have also written for the Independent Florida Alligator, the largest student-run newspaper in the U.S., as a freelancer. I mostly wrote about local news for the metro section of the paper.
</p><p>
            A few fun facts about me: I am a dual citizen – American and Brazilian. I am fluent in Portuguese and speak intermediate Spanish. I have an outside concentration in psychology because I am curious about the way people think, feel and interact, which is why I enjoy writing about them so much. My mom lives in San Francisco and my dad lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I will always choose the cat’s side.
